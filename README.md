# EECS 4421, Introduction to Robotics
The course consists of 5 assignments ranging from basics of ROS, Gazebo and Python scripting all the way up to controlling a real robot arm remotely through SSH. The assignment structure and breakdown is provided below in an attempt to maintain a timeline of concepts learnt in the course, and compare them with the expected learning outcomes in the course syllabus.

### Resources
Here are some useful links for ROS:
1. [ROS tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

Here are some useful links for code documentation and syntax:

### Report Format
Quoting the eClass submission link:
> Your submission must be provided as a single pdf, and must not exceed 100mb in size. 
> You should provide documented code when code is provided, but imagery, text, etc. are certainly appropriate. 
> Do not submit external code (I can look it up -- just provide a URL).

## 1 *Basics of ROS, Gazebo and Getting Familiar with Model Libraries*
The main goal of this assignment is to get an understanding of the Robot Operating System, ROS for short, and how robots are simulated using Gazebo.
